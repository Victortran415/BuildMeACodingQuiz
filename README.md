# Web APIs: Code Quiz

In this week homework, the task was to create a Code-Related quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created a 5 question quiz with a timer. When the user click the "Being Quiz" button, the timer should start counting down. Each question will present the current score that is equivalent to the timer. Whenever the user gets an answer wrong, they will be penalized by 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz a prompt will appear to notify the user that the quiz has been completed.
